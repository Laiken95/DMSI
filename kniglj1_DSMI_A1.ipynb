The file containing the data set for this assignment is `crime.csv`.  Make sure you open the file and visually inspect it yourself to understand the structure of your data. \n",

Understanding what keeps customers engaged is valuable. Consequently, there's growing interest among companies to develop better churn-detection techniques.
